     Hello my name is Harrison Cordill. I live in Kansas City, Missouri, but currently reside in Columbia for schooling at Mizzou. I graduated from Staley High School in 2019 to achieve my high school diploma, and attended my first 2 years of college at Metropolitan Community College to achieve my associates degree in art. I am a junior at Mizzou, and I am building to carry out a Bachelor's degree in Digital Storytelling that will help further a career in this path. This field would include jobs such as, graphic design, script writing, and teaching concepts using digital media. This is accomplished by mixing and matching audio, video, and images to tell a coherent plot or reenactment of a story. This field will also help me prepare for other parts of the modern working world. Many things are becoming more digitalized and going ahead and beyond of the changing times will help with that.
