<h2>Hello my name is Harrison, and welcome to my website!</h2>
<p>This website is to act like a brief understanding of the sport of soccer and how the sport works as a whole. I want to focus on the professional side of the sport with the rules being explained as well. I will discuss things such as how certain tournaments are run whether they are national or league based, what the differences between the leagues are and how certain playstyles stick with these individual leagues, and basic rules of the sport so that more people can enjoy it as I do. My goal and objective of my website is simple. My mission is to spark an interest in someone to pursue watching this sport so the interest of the sport in the United Stateas can grow.</p>
