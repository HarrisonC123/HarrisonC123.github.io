    <h2>Basics of The Game</h2>
    <p>
        Soccer is a sport that is 11v11 and has both teams on the pitch attempting to score on the opposing side. The sport relies a lot on outplaying the other team rather than using brute force such as american football. Using key passes and skill moves can ensure the ball ends up in the other net in a reasonable amount of time, opening space throughout the pitch. A usual match consists of a goalkeeper, four defenders, and a mix and match of midfielders and attackers depending on the certain team's playstyle. The biggest point of confusion I will see with people getting into the sport for the first time is the rule of offsides. Passes can not be made to a player past the last defender or it will be called as offsides. This is to mitigate players from standing right next to the opposing team's goal and then just scoring from a long ball to them. There are many smaller rules that this video will be able to go into more detail about.

    <h3>Tournaments of Soccer</h3>
    
    <br />

<p>
The tournaments in soccer go from as large as nation wide to as minimal as league wide. The biggest tournament that most people are aware of is the World Cup that takes place every 4 years. This tournament is the decision on what country is the absolute best of the best in the sport. millions of people watch worldwide to see the outcomes of these matches because this tournament in particular has every player playing at their absolute best trying to represent their country's name. A smaller but equally as important achievement are the league titles as it decides the best teams in the respective leagues. Every league has these league titles whether you are talking about the Bundesliga, La Liga, Premier League, or Serie A just to name a few. Teams competing to be at the top of the standings is something that they strive for, but for some it is just to not be relegated. Relegation happens when a team is in the bottom three of the standings for their league and they are bumped down a division. When dropped to a division lower than where they were, the only way to get back up to the higher division is to get in the top 3 standings for the league they were relegated to. This is the basis of how relegation and promotion works in league titles. I have attached a video that goes more in depth to this process as well.

<h4>Differences Between The Top Leagues</h4>
<br />
There are differences in how players play depending on their leagues. Every division of the Bundesliga has a much more physical way of play in that they will push and shove each other off the ball where in other leagues it would result in someone "flopping". In the La Liga it is favorable to have a style of play of quick passing. One of the greatest managers in soccer of all time by the name of Pep Guardiola had a famous saying, "Take the ball, pass the ball". Quick successions of passing resulted in very satisfying goals scored by his club at the time, Barcelona FC. In the Premier League it is favorable to get the ball to the wing positions on the pitch to sprint down the field and cross the ball into the box to score their goals. These are just 3 of the most watched leagues and there are many more examples of this strategy to score that spans throughout every league. Here is a trailer for a documentary made that shows the style of play that Pep Guardiola would use that would win them many titles in his days managing Barcelona.
