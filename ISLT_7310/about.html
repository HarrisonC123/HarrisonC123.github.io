<p>I graduated from High school in 2019 and went on to a <em>Community College</em> that was close to where I lived which gave easy access to furthering my education. I was able to go here for a low cost because I was in the A+ program at my school that supplied me money to pay for my classes. <br>
     I would be at Maple Woods Community College from August 2019 until May 2021. Here I was getting most of my general education out of the way to focus on my career path at <em>Mizzou</em> later that year. At Mizzou I am majoring in <strong>digital storytelling</strong> which uses video, audio, and images to create a story using technology. If all things go as planned, I will be graduating from Mizzou in May 2023. A quote that I like regarding school/work is one my grandpa used to tell me. </p>
